                <h4>Arrays</h4>
                <p>In C, arrays are fundamental data structures that store a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. <br>They provide efficient indexed access, allowing elements to be retrieved or modified using their index. <br>Arrays are declared with a specific size and can be initialized with values at the time of declaration. While powerful for managing collections of data, arrays in C are limited by their fixed size and the need for careful index management to avoid out-of-bounds errors. <br>Multidimensional arrays extend this concept to more complex data structures, such as matrices.</p>

            <section id = "linked lists">
                <h4>Linked Lists</h4>
                <p>In C, a linked list is a dynamic data structure consisting of nodes, each containing data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, allowing for flexible and efficient insertions and deletions at any position in the list.<br> The primary types of linked lists include singly linked lists, where each node points to the next node, and doubly linked lists, where nodes have pointers to both the next and previous nodes. <br>While linked lists provide advantages in terms of dynamic size and ease of modification, they require careful management of pointers and incur additional memory overhead compared to arrays.</p>

            <section id="stacks">
                <h4>Stacks</h4>
                <p>In C, a stack is a data structure that operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the most recently added element is the first to be removed. Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, and they support basic operations such as push (adding an element), pop (removing the top element), and peek (viewing the top element without removal). <br>Stacks are widely used in scenarios like function call management, expression evaluation, and algorithm design due to their efficient handling of data with a simple and intuitive structure.</p>

                    <h4>Lists</h4>
                    <p>In Python, lists are versatile and mutable sequences that allow you to store collections of items, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists. <br>Unlike arrays in some other programming languages, Python lists can contain elements of different data types within the same list. Lists are ordered, meaning the elements have a defined sequence, and they can be accessed by their index. You can easily add, remove, or modify elements, making lists a powerful tool for handling dynamic collections of data.</p>

                <section id = "tuples">
                    <h4>Tuples</h4>
                    <p>Tuples in Python are immutable sequences that store collections of items. Like lists, tuples can contain elements of different data types, but once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. <br>This immutability makes tuples useful for storing data that should not be modified, ensuring its integrity. Tuples are ordered, and their elements can be accessed using indices. <br>They are often used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or elements of a record, where the structure and content need to remain constant. </p>

                <section id ="sets">
                    <h4>Sets</h4>
                    <p>Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements, meaning they do not allow duplicate values. Unlike lists and tuples, sets are mutable, allowing you to add or remove elements, but since they are unordered, the items do not have a defined sequence, and you cannot access them by index. <br>Sets are particularly useful for operations that involve checking membership, removing duplicates from a sequence, or performing mathematical operations like unions, intersections, and differences between collections of data.</p>
